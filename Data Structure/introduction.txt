1. What is Data structures ?
	Data structures are the building blocks of any computer program as they help in organizing and manipulating data in an efficient manner. 

2. What Are the Different Types of Data Structures?
	The different types of data structures are: 

		Arrays: 
			A collection of data values stored sequentially
		Stacks: 
			Last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structures where the element placed last is accessed first.
		Queues: 
			A first-in-first-out data structure. 
		Linked lists: 
			A collection of data values stored in a linear order and connected to each other
		Graphs: 
			A data structure in which data values are placed in nodes connected by edges 
		Trees: 
			Similar to a linked list, but with data values linked in a hierarchical fashion
		Heaps: 
			A binary tree data structure wherein parent data values can be compared to child data values
		Hash table: 
			A table where each value is assigned a key and then stored, making accessing individual values easy. 

3. Linear Data Structures vs Non-Linear Data Structures: What Is the Difference?
	A linear data structure stores data in a linear sequence. You can only traverse the data structure in that linear sequence. 
	Arrays and stacks are examples of linear data structures. 

	Non-linear data structures arrange data in ways that are not linear. A graph, for example, has nodes which are connected to each other through edges. 
	The relationships between the data values are defined by which nodes are connected through edges, and not by a sequential arrangement. 
	Trees are also non-linear data structures. 
	
4. What is Dynamic data structures?
	Dynamic data structures are data structures whose size is not fixed.
