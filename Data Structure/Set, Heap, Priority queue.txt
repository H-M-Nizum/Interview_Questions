1. Heap : 
	Heap is a array representation in complete binary tree. Always sorted.
	Heap creation time complexity O(nlog(n))
	Heap delation time complexity O(nlog(n))
	Heap sort time complexity O(nlog(n))
	There are two type of heap __ 
		1. max heap :-  parent >= children 
		2. min heap :-  parent <= children
	Insertion complexity O(log(n))
	Insertion : 
		max heap - The new node value if greater then parent value , just swap them.
		min heap - The new node value if less then parent value , just swap them.
	
	delete :
		complexity O(log(n))

2. Heapify : 
	Heapify reduce heap creation time complexity.
	n element's of array leap node start (n/2)+1 to n. Heapify work in non leap node.
