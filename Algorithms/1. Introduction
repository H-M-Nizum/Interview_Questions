1. Time complexity :	
	O(1) 		---> 	Constant
	O(logn) 	---> 	Lagarithmic
	O(sqrt(n))  ---> 	Squre root
	O(n logn)	--->	
	O(n) 		---> 	Linear Time
	O(n^2) 		---> 	Quadratic
	O(n^3) 		---> 	Cubic
	O(2^n) 		--->  	Exponitial

2. Divide And Conquer : 	(Divide -> Conquer -> Combine)  O(n log(n))
	Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts, 
	solving each part individually, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem. 
	* The following are some standard algorithms that follow Divide and Conquer algorithm ___
		i. Quicksort 
		ii. Merge Sort
		iii. Closest Pair of Points
		iv. Cooleyâ€“Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm
